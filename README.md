# 🚀 RTLify GPT – Seamless RTL Experience for GPT Platforms

**RTLify GPT** is a browser extension that brings perfect right-to-left (RTL) language support—such as Hebrew and Arabic—to GPT-based platforms like ChatGPT. Say goodbye to broken formatting, reversed text, and messy math equations. This extension ensures that RTL content displays cleanly and correctly, even when mixed with mathematical expressions or English text.
